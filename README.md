# rustty
ReWriting one of my old Go projects in Rust.

A terminal with term level aliases, logging, additional modules and key-shorcuts.

*Note:*
Will be nothing working or good to see here for quite a while.
Very limited time and completely new to Rust gives that this will take a long time before I'll have anything working.
